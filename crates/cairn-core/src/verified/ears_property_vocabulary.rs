//! EARS property vocabulary: classifies EARS requirement responses into
//! checkable property predicates.
//!
//! This module implements the c-earchin vocabulary bridge: an EARS requirement
//! response (the text after "shall") is classified against a fixed vocabulary
//! of pure-boolean predicates. If the response resolves to a predicate, the
//! requirement becomes a real property witness. If it does not resolve, the
//! requirement is marked `recorded_only` — it carries structure but proves
//! nothing, and a "0 verified" result means "nothing was verified," not "all
//! good."
//!
//! This is the c-earchin `verification-scope` discipline applied to cairn:
//! translating a requirement is not the same as proving it. A witness becomes
//! a proof property only when its response resolves to a vocabulary predicate.
